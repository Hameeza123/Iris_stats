# Iris_stats
Working with pandas to analyze sample data

I am experimenting with statistical and data visualization techniques using the classic small dataset from Fisher, 1936, 
on Iris flower measuremnets. Although I am not a flower expert, I hope to be able to work with the data in the files and 
understand it better through the following computational techniques using pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.
